# TFB – Geochemical Analysis of Mercury's Surface

This repository contains the code and data related to my Bachelor's Thesis (TFB), conducted at the University of Liège. The project focuses on comparing spectral data from NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft with partial melting experimental data.

 
## 🧪 Project Objective

The goal is to compare the elemental ratios Mg/Si, Ca/Si, and Al/Si observed at the surface of Mercury with those obtained from partial melting experiments at different pressures (1.5, 3.5, and 5 GPa).  
This comparison helps to constrain the depth of origin of Mercury’s volcanic rocks and their mantle source conditions.
